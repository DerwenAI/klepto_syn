What are common money mule red flags?

An essential step in tackling _mule fraud_ is knowing when to
investigate an account or a customer -- either an individual or a
business -- for mule activity.

Some common money mule red flags include:

  * Changes in transactional behavior, including sudden international transfers, large purchases of crypto currency, or other large non-typical transfers
  * Rapid movement of funds through the account with little to no balance retention
  * Multiple cash deposits just under reporting thresholds, followed by rapid transfers
  * Accounts with minimal activity suddenly receiving large incoming transfers
  * Abnormalities identified via online behavior, such as hesitation inputting data, keystroke delays, etc.
  * Round dollar amount purchases that are frequent and/or in large amounts, which can indicate gift card purchases for money muling
  * Absence of typical account behavior.

# Rapid Movement of Funds

The unexplained and rapid movement of funds between accounts or institutions can signal attempts to obfuscate the money trail, e.g., multiple large transfers from one account to various offshore accounts in a matter of hours or days. Large and frequent transfers of money within a short period, could involve moving money through multiple accounts or countries quickly, may trigger the need for further investigation of a transaction.

Particularly significant when:

  - transactions move funds to or from high-risk jurisdictions or countries with weak anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls

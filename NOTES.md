## process abstraction

  1. Load entities for people in roles, with beneficiary metadata.
  2. Load entities for shell corp intermediary organizations.
  3. Load network motif patterns representing fraud tradecraft.
  4. Simulate a network plus transactions based on all of the above.
  5. Generate output data in node-link format.


## misc. requirements

  * We must describe the pathing and relations within graph data in flexible ways.
  * Formally speaking, these tradecraft patterns tend to be _walks_ or _circuits_.
  * Tradecraft motifs are not merely data queries, nor merely topological census.
  * Algebraic geometry, i.e., using an adjacency matrix, does not provide rich enough annotation.
  * We might adapt approaches from life sciences, e.g., _activity motifs_.
  * We probably don't need to delve into the topological math as far as _cohomology_.


## outstanding questions

Q: How should we represent network motifs?

  - Cypher paths subset in GraphFrames <https://github.com/Graphlet-AI/graphml-class/blob/main/graphml_class/stats/motif.py>
    - Seems ginormous and slow, with loads of dependencies?
    - GraphFrames has virtues, although we don't want to depend on this overall?
    - Could we use a pure Python Cypher parser instead?
      - Pypher <https://github.com/emehrkay/Pypher>
      - Pycypher <https://github.com/Mizzlr/pycypher>

  - Gremlin <https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_features> provides a graph traversal language

  - SNAP <https://snap-stanford.github.io/cs224w-notes/preliminaries/motifs-and-structral-roles_lecture>
    - RoIX and other methods seem more about identifying structural roles?

  - Mermaid syntax <https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html>
    - ER diagrams for many use cases, though perhaps not adaptable to network motifs?

  - DSL in DotMotif <https://github.com/aplbrain/dotmotif/wiki/Getting-Started>
    - Lacks variable-length path representation?
    - Lacks metadata on either entities or relations?


Q: Would topological methods, e.g., _sheaf theory_, provide useful formalisms for general descriptions?


Q: Can we reuse controlled vocabularies related to the data sources and use cases?
